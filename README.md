## ‚õàÔ∏èOverview
Data has been used very extensively in the field of soccer. One prime example is the robust number of sport analysts in Liverpool who take key decisions for recruitment based on the data. I am a huge fan of soccer in general and heavily follow Spanish soccer (LaLiga). This project focuses on building an interactive Streamlit chatbot designed to analyze football matches and player performance under different weather conditions. Using an XGBoost classification model trained on match stats and player performance metrics, combined with natural language understanding via LangChain and Mistral(Ollama), the chatbot allows users to ask intuitive questions and receive smart, data-backed insights.

## üß†What Does This Chatbot Do?
* Predict match outcomes with weather conditions as a key influence
* Identify best players suited to specific match conditions like rain, wind, or clear skies
* Compare team performance across weather-based scenarios
* Respond to natural language queries such as:
  * ‚ÄúWho plays best for Barcelona when it rains?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the win chance for Real Madrid vs Atletico Madrid on a windy day?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhich teams won most matches when it rained in 2022?‚Äù

## üíªSetup Instructions
```
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FootballInsightsChatbot.git
cd FootballInsightsChatbot

# 2. Create and activate environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4.Install Ollama and Mistral
Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com/library/mistral:instruct
After installation, make sure to Start mistral in your terminal with:
ollama pull mistral:7b

# 4. Launch the chatbot
streamlit run chatbot_app.py

```

### Notes:
- Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** and **pip** installed on your machine.
- The `requirements.txt` includes all necessary dependencies like **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **XGBoost**, **SHAP**, etc.
- After launching, the app should open in your browser for interaction.

## üîçExample Chat Queries
You can interact with the chatbot using natural football questions like:
* ‚ÄúWhat is the win chance for Barcelona vs Real Madrid in 2022 on a rainy day?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhich player from Atletico Madrid is best suited for windy conditions?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhich teams had the highest win rate when it rained last season?‚Äù

## What Does This Advanced Predictor Do?
The **Advanced Predictor App** uses machine learning to predict the outcome of football matches and provide insights into player performance based on varying conditions. Below are the key features of the app:

- **Predict Match Outcomes**:
  - Uses an **XGBoost machine learning model** trained on historical football match data.
  - Predicts the probability of a **home win** based on player and team statistics, match conditions, and historical data.

- **Player Suitability Based on Match Scenario**:
  - Identifies the best-suited **players** for a given match scenario (e.g., weather conditions, home vs. away).
  - Select a **team** (home or away) to filter players and receive recommendations for the top-performing players.

- **Scenario-Based Predictions**:
  - Choose from predefined **scenarios** like:
    - **Clear day** (no weather disruptions),
    - **Rainy winter** (heavy rain),
    - **Windy derby** (high winds).
  - Adjusts the prediction based on the selected scenario, providing a more accurate outcome.

- **SHAP Analysis for Transparency**:
  - Provides **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** analysis to explain the model‚Äôs decision-making.
  - Visualizes the importance of different features (e.g., player stats, weather) in influencing the prediction.

- **Visual Results**:
  - Displays the **predicted home win probability** for the selected match.
  - Shows the **top 5 players** best suited for the selected scenario.
  - **SHAP summary plot** to visually demonstrate feature importance.

- **Interactive User Interface**:
  - Built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to:
    - Select a **match**, **team**, and **scenario**.
    - View instant predictions, player suggestions, and feature impact all in an easy-to-read format.
